# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project due Mon 24 Aug 12:30 am

# The four things you should have
1. The raw data
2. A tidy data set
3. A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set
4. An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 -> 2,3
 
# The assignment
1.You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
1.1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
1.2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
1.3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1.4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
1.5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

# Notes and reminders to self

A codebook describes the data and the variables (column names) in the data set. For this course project an elaborate codebook is not necessary. Basically, describe any transformation to the original column names by way of listing each variable in your tidy data and a brief description which can be found in one of the existing files provided for the assignment. Any units of measurement should be included; read the existing documentation for a clue about the units for this assignment; it is easy to overlook. The codebook should not describe the algorithms used to process the data. 

The README.md document is the proper place to describe any algorithms if you decide it warrants explanation. Although for the course project enumerating the steps to run the processing script, run_analysis.R, along with any assumptions about the data should be part of README.md. The codebook is not a copy of the processing script but you could include non-obvious algorithms as R code or pseudo-code or the entire script as an appendix - not necessary for this course.

Also, the overview of the processing steps in the code, and the reasoning behind any decisions you made about things to include or exclude goes in the README.md document.
