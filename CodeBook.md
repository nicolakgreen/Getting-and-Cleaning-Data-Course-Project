#A codebook describes the data and the variables (column names) in the data set. For this course project an elaborate codebook is not necessary. Basically, describe any transformation to the original column names by way of listing each variable in your tidy data and a brief description which can be found in one of the existing files provided for the assignment. Any units of measurement should be included; read the existing documentation for a clue about the units for this assignment; it is easy to overlook. The codebook should not describe the algorithms used to process the data.
